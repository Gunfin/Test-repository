I have deleted the poem because it wasn't that great.

I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint
could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time.
But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the
smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in
my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to
get it so that I don't have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here,
so the doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.

I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum superposition of grand opening and going out of business sale.
It is both and neither at once until an observer records the state at which point it becomes one or the other.
But because you know exactly where the store is located, you cannot know how fast it is going out of business
because of your uncertainty about its business momentum.
All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores are popping
into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe. Without the pressure of
this quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.
We can see evidence of this when a pair is created such that one half is within the sales radius of a supermassive
furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.
